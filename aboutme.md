At [Intel](www.intel.com), he used his knowledge to tackle problems in data center optimization using cluster analysis, enriched market sizing models by implementing sentiment analysis from social media feeds, and improved data-driven decision making in one of the top 5 global supply chains. At [Tamr](www.tamr.com), he built models to unify large amounts of messy data across multiple silos for some of the largest corporations in the world. He earned a PhD in Applied Mathematics from Arizona State University where his research spanned image reconstruction, dynamical systems, mathematical epidemiology and oncology.
